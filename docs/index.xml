      <description>More about me &amp;hellip; I have two Master&amp;rsquo;s degrees in linguistics, one from UCLA where I had started a PhD and the other from North Carolina State University. I studied laboratory phonology, sociophonetics, and statistical research methods.
I&amp;rsquo;m originally from Minnesota, but I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in Wisconsin, France, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and California (twice!).
My favorite things are: watching horror and scifi movies, bike riding on the beach, discovering new places to eat, and struggling to decide what I want to learn next.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I tweeted that I wanted to explore new hobbies. For the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve engrossed myself in a job I love. My career development has been really rewarding professionally, but lately I&amp;rsquo;ve felt personally underdeveloped. My current hobbies include seeing movies (especially horror and sci-fi) and exploring my new home of Los Angeles (biking, hiking, and of course eating). While these things are fun, I feel like I could be doing and creating so much more.</description>

      <description>Hello world! I&amp;rsquo;m recreating my personal website using Hugo. Previously it was written in Bootstrap. I hope you enjoy the new look and layout.</description>
