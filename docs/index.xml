&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-about-me&#34;&gt;More about me &amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two Master&amp;rsquo;s degrees in linguistics, one from UCLA where I had started a PhD and the other from North Carolina State University. I studied laboratory phonology, sociophonetics, and statistical research methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m originally from Minnesota, but I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in Wisconsin, France, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and California (twice!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite things are: watching horror and scifi movies, bike riding, discovering new places to eat, going to shows (music andd comedy) and struggling to decide what I want to learn next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where you can find some of my past work (not necessarily reflective of current work):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Medium &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@meganrisdal&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/discussion&#34;&gt;Engaging&lt;/a&gt; with the data science community on Kaggle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/kernels?sortBy=voteCount&amp;amp;group=profile&amp;amp;pageSize=20&amp;amp;userId=495305&#34;&gt;Writing R or Python code&lt;/a&gt; to analyze data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizing community challenges, like launching Kaggle&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/11/16/introducing-data-science-for-good-events-on-kaggle/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data Science for Good Program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of this public work was in my &amp;ldquo;20% time&amp;rdquo;. Behind the scenes, I have a lot of fun wearing many hats as a product manager including writing specs, doing user interviews, analyzing data, collaborating with designers and developers, doing research and strategy, writing documentation, getting creative with marketing, etc. I&amp;rsquo;ve even had the opportunity to play developer when I wrote the server-side code to create &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/meta-kaggle&#34;&gt;Meta Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;, Kaggle&amp;rsquo;s public dataset about &amp;hellip; Kaggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in North Hollywood, CA with my husband and our cat. I work at Stack Overflow as a Product Manager for public Q&amp;amp;A. Previously, I was at Kaggle (a Google company) for three years where I worked as a product lead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Product Management as an Episode of Black Mirror</title>
      <link>https://mrisdal.github.io/blog/posts/product-management-as-an-episode-of-black-mirror/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Being a product manager on a small remote, distributed team reminds me a lot of the Black Mirror episode, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Right_Back&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be Right Back&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this episode of the sci-fi anthology series, a woman uses an AI service to bring back her recently deceased partner. She does so by uploading all of their text messages, emails, voicemails, and any other computer-mediated conversation she shared with him to the, uhh, Cloud I suppose. That&amp;rsquo;s one use case for GDPR data requests! All of this data was then used to train a super language model to embody (literally) a clone of her prematurely departed husband.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what does this have to do with being a product manager on a remote, distributed team? The sheer volume of written text I produce, of course! So much you could nearly hope to train a clone of me someday, language model and all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://source.unsplash.com/eOSqRq2Qm1c/800x450&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by David Clode on Unsplash&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On remote, distributed teams, asynchronous, high quality communication is essential. Now, I &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; have experience working on remote, distributed teams (so nothing to compare it to), but hopefully this becomes more of the norm. And in any case I think there are a lot of great reasons to write and write a LOT as a product manager. And ideally, you write in a way that faithfully transfers your product thinking, insights, and vision faithfully to Google Docs text and formatting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few reasons why I think Black Mirror worthy documentation should be a best practice regardless of whether you&amp;rsquo;re colocated and shoulder-to-shoulder or if multiple timezones separate you and your closest collaborators:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A no-brainer (maybe literally if this catches on): Clearly written specs should enable my coworkers to focus on building uninterrupted as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Propaganda!&amp;rdquo; Framing my artifacts up-front with context which is an opportunity to weave a consistent thread in the story I want to weave for our product&amp;rsquo;s direction. It then becomes a story I can trust my team to internalize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like designing a redundant system&amp;hellip; if I make myself partly redundant through documentation, I might be able to afford to spend some of my time on a bit of extra higher level strategy and planning here and there. ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you go, that&amp;rsquo;s why being a product manager at a remote, distributed company is like being in an episode of Black Mirror (except in a good way!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Amass Engineering Knowledge as a Product Manager</title>
      <link>https://mrisdal.github.io/blog/posts/amassing-swe-knowledge-as-a-pm/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;For about the past two years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a product manager at Kaggle where I work on our public data platform as well as (more recently) our Google Cloud Platform integrations team. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to do quite a bit of reflection on my career thanks in part to having a mentee (being a mentor is awesome!). The other day she asked me how I &amp;ldquo;amassed as much engineering knowledge as I have&amp;rdquo;. (She asks great questions!) I shared &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MeganRisdal/status/1096583566190731264?s=20&#34;&gt;my answer on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and, you know what, I want to blog more so I&amp;rsquo;m sharing it here, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I had to spend a few days thinking about how to respond in a sage, mentor-ly way because it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been something I was necessarily intentional about (my interest in software development is more of a curiosity, probably). At the same time, I definitely had a couple of motivators for accumulating engineering knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product managers spend their days influencing without authority. Understanding and sympathizing with your engineering coworkers can help with this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apart from the website about goldfish I made when I was 12, I don&amp;rsquo;t already have a background in computer science or software development. I could elaborate on why exactly I include this, but I&amp;rsquo;ll save that for another time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After thinking about her question for a bit and jotting down my thoughts in my favorite note-taking app, Sublime Text, here&amp;rsquo;s what I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-invest-time-to-learn-what-it-takes-to-describe-architecture-and-key-services-at-a-high-level&#34;&gt;1. Invest time to learn what it takes to describe architecture and key services at a high level&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a good idea for two reasons. First, this information should be readily accessible in some form&amp;ndash;take advantage of it! Just ask for the documentation for it or, if necessary, schedule a chat with the owner engineer. Second, this will be one of the highest leverage ways to successfully gauge feasibility of new features. This has saved me a number of times from needing to bother our tech leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give an example, when our tech lead was on paternity leave last Northern hemisphere fall, I took over managing our engineering team. Early on, we began experiencing a lot of instability with one of our services. I took the time then to review all of the available architecture and desgin docs (and even a 1hr recorded onboarding video!). From this I was able to draft a design doc proposing specific changes which were ultimately implemented (with a lot of input from my coworkers, of course!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-read-engineering-design-docs-for-fun-especially-requirements-and-alternatives-considered&#34;&gt;2. Read engineering design docs for fun, especially requirements and alternatives considered&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fun, I promise! This is a lot like #2, but it&amp;rsquo;s more about understanding the process, context, and conversation that happens around engineering designs. Plus understanding what&amp;rsquo;s important and why to your coworkers is a great way to empathize with them. And of course, it can also ensure you&amp;rsquo;re up-to-date on things like database schema changes, new services, etc. that might help you answer questions or inspire product ideas in the future. It&amp;rsquo;s helped me in this way a number of times!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-ask-swes-you-work-with-for-more-technical-details-than-you-may-actually-need&#34;&gt;3. Ask SWEs you work with for more technical details than you may actually need&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, these are all so easy! Even if it&amp;rsquo;s out of pure curiosity that I ask for additional technical details, doing so is a great way to test my knowledge and show my coworkers I care about understanding the problems they&amp;rsquo;re solving. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that my developer coworkers are always more than happy to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-have-and-sometimes-use-a-development-environment-like-your-coworkers&#34;&gt;4. Have (and sometimes use!) a development environment like your coworkers&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this might be relatively minor and is probably not necessary in all (or maybe most) cases, but it&amp;rsquo;s given me a lot of appreciation for how much our team invests in developer productivity and dev tooling. I like knowing how to make minor changes and deploy them. And my coworkers that helped me out liked seeing me contribute to our codebase and were super happy to help. I set up the server-side C# code that creates the CSVs we use for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/meta-kaggle&#34;&gt;Meta Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;, Kaggle&amp;rsquo;s public dataset about &amp;hellip; Kaggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so there&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with to answer my coworker&amp;rsquo;s question. I&amp;rsquo;m still learning, but these are nonetheless some things that have helped me do my job better (and enjoy it more). The common thread my pieces of advice share, I think, is that they exhibit care for my coworkers, the things they work on, and how they make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final piece of meta advice from here is to demonstrate that you&amp;rsquo;re listening and working on improving your engineering knowledge. The more you make product decisions with the things you learned through the help of your coworkers as input, the more people will come to trust you. And in turn, they&amp;rsquo;ll share more with you. It&amp;rsquo;s a really rewarding cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be curious. Be empathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reply&#34;&gt;Reply&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the conversation and discuss on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Hobbies</title>
      <link>https://mrisdal.github.io/blog/posts/new-hobbies/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Oct 2018 17:53:46 -0700</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I tweeted that I wanted to explore new hobbies. For the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve engrossed myself in a job I love. My career development has been really rewarding professionally, but lately I&amp;rsquo;ve felt personally underdeveloped. My current hobbies include seeing movies (especially horror and sci-fi) and exploring my new home of Los Angeles (biking, hiking, and of course eating). While these things are fun, I feel like I could be doing and &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like everyone I know is into some really awesome hobbies: kite surfing, beekeeping, knitting, curling, trapeze, etc. etc. And I used to do some cool things myself: play oboe, sing in a Georgian folk choir, mountain bike. But lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been filling my time with a lot of Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to poll my cooler-than-me Twitter audience. What are some interesting hobby ideas I can try out on weekends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I just had the idea to try one totally new hobby per week. Or maybe every other week... What are some cheap, cool weekend hobbies you like? 🎨🖌️🌱🎹📝&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(The plant emoji obviously means fairy gardening.)&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Megan Risdal 👾 (@MeganRisdal) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MeganRisdal/status/1041602406172123136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 17, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ideas flooded in! In case you might be inspired to try something new yourself, here are all of the suggestions I received:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Juggling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puzzles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voxel Art (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.voxelmade.com/magicavoxel/&#34;&gt;MagicaVoxel&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaggle Competitions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🍰&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Birdwatching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sketching portraits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mod podge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skateboarding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manga/anime sketching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a local food and travel blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meet new people from different cultures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ukele&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tango&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Martial arts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drawing painting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit museums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee/ice cream/chocolate tasting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paper crafts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wine tasting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to make 3D polyhedra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make notebooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help local refugees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach English&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I ignored ALL of these suggestions. For my first hobby, I&amp;rsquo;m not straying far from my comfort zone (I am still in my sweats at home, after all)&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m creating this new personal website. Now, there&amp;rsquo;s a reason why I&amp;rsquo;m spending my first hobby project this way, of course. With this blog, I&amp;rsquo;ll now have a place for me to document my &amp;ldquo;new hobby&amp;rdquo; hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so that&amp;rsquo;s it for the meta-post. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll look forward to my next!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
