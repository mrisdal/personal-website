## More about me ...
I have two Master's degrees in linguistics, one from UCLA where I had started a PhD and the other from North Carolina State University. I studied laboratory phonology, sociophonetics, and statistical research methods.

I'm originally from Minnesota, but I've lived in Wisconsin, France, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and California (twice!).

My favorite things are: watching horror and scifi movies, bike riding on the beach, discovering new places to eat, and struggling to decide what I want to learn next.

In a given day at Kaggle I might be: giving a talk at an event, [blogging](https://medium.com/@meganrisdal), designing [new product features](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/39194), analyzing data to make product decisions, [organizing community challenges](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/discussion/36698), creating documentation, collecting user feedback, collaborating with developers and designers, and [writing R or Python code](https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/kernels?sortBy=votes&group=my&pageSize=20&language=all&outputType=all&userId=495305).

I now live in Santa Monica, CA with my husband and our cat. I work at Google > Kaggle in Los Angeles.
